## Principles of object oriented programming   
 1. Abstraction: functions in a class
 2. Encapsulation: Class encapsulates data and functions
      Data Hiding
 3. Inheritance: An object can inherit properties from another class
 4. Polymorphism: Same class different forms. Polymorphism can be achieved through inheritance.
 
 Programming is concerned about: data and operations on data
 In a class data is made private to avoid mishandling.
