## Principles of object oriented programming   
 1. Abstraction: functions in a class
 2. Encapsulation: Class encapsulates data and functions
      Data Hiding: Access specifiers- private, public, protector, get x is accessor and set x is mutator
 3. Inheritance: An object can inherit properties from another class
 4. Polymorphism: Same class different forms. Polymorphism can be achieved through inheritance.
 
 Programming is concerned about: data and operations on data
 In a class data is made private to avoid mishandling.
 ### Types of constructors
 1. Default constructor
 2. Non-parameterized constructor
 3. Parameterized constructor
 4. Copy constructor: Disadvantage - If dynamic mem alloc, then both the objs would point to the same mem. Shallow copy and deep copy construcors.
